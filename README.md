# silver8
a my own cpu

- no linux build (yet)

# windows instructions
1. either build it from the source (preferred) or download it from the latest releawse.
2. download program.s8 (to just make sure the emulator works)
3. MAKE SURE "silver8.exe" AND "program.s8" are in the same directory!
4. open up a terminal in the same directory
5. run ".\silver8.exe"
6. it should output whatever program you ran!

P.S the program file *has* to be named "program.s8" it will not work otherwise. i havent really implemented a "file-loader" or anything like that yet.
